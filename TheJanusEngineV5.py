    # The Comparative Synthesis Prompt
    synthesis_prompt = textwrap.dedent(f"""
    You are tasked with generating a "Comparative Synthesis". You will compare and contrast two different creative works analyzed through the same analytical lens: **{lens_name}**.

    Work A Title: {work_a_title}
    <analysis_a>
    {analysis_a}
    </analysis_a>

    Work B Title: {work_b_title}
    <analysis_b>
    {analysis_b}
    </analysis_b>

    Instructions:
    1. **Identify Key Themes:** Based on the provided analyses, identify the central themes, findings, or arguments that emerged for each work under the {lens_name} lens.
    2. **Dissonance and Resonance:** Analyze the points of contrast (dissonance) and similarity (resonance) between Work A and Work B. How does applying the same lens reveal different aspects of each work?
    3. **Emergent Insights:** Discuss what new understanding emerges from the comparison itself. How does seeing these two works side-by-side deepen the interpretation of both?
    4. **Structure:** Format your response as a cohesive essay with clear sections for comparison, contrast, and synthesis.
